# tor-onion-uptime-checker
Python script to check the uptime status of a TOR (The Onion Router) URL

This script uses the requests library to send a request to the specified TOR URL through the TOR proxy, which is set using the proxies parameter. If the request is successful, it prints the status code of the response. If the request fails, it prints a message indicating that the TOR URL is down.

This is just a simple example, and you can modify it to suit your specific needs. For example, you might want to parse the response data to extract specific information, or you might want to use a different method to check the uptime status of the TOR URL.
